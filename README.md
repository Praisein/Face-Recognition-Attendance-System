# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
This is a college project which uses device camera to recognize student's face form db and mark their attendance. It is created using flask. For DB json files were used for easy access and understanding of flow.
This app also restrcits users who try to access this local flask app through device ip and blocks them untill the main user permits them to use the attendance marking page. 
You need to get you own pytorch model and store it in a folder named models.
